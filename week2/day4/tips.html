        <h2>DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF</h2>
        <p><em>Reduce repetition is the philiosophy.</em> This is a general software development principle and can be applied in any programming language, as well as in CSS. As we can understand from its name, DRY aims to avoid or reduce repetition as much as possible. DRY also helps out with bandwidth increase site's loading speed. Oppositing from DRY is WET, Wasting Everyon's Time / We Enjoy Typing.</p>
        <h2>Don't use inline-styles</h2>
        <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FgG7zNZgDKv4%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" alt="">
        <p>The use of inline-styles is very tricky. Although it provides exceptions but over abusing it may cause difficulties in code maintaining. For example, if a website is using large amount of inline-styles, by having a small change, would take a while to search and very hard to read. Another downside for inline-styles is it will cause overwrite issue that might have conflict with external css.</p>
        <h2>Keep the design simple</h2>
        <p>It is the best to have reusable and repeatable design for developer to use more than once. It not only increases the efficiently of developing but also helps out let the website to have a consistant style though out the whole site.</p>
        <h2>Use Shorthands</h2>
        <p>Some of the CSS properties like paddings, margins, fonts and borders can be written in a much simpler way by shorthands. Using shorthands helps to reduce the lines of rules.</p>
        <h2>Break a large file into mini CSS files</h2>
        <p>By doing this, will prevent A style that not only focus on the css functions but also decupling between css styles.</p>
