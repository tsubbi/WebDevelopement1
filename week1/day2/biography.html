                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Homer Simpson was born on May 12, 1956, to Abraham and Mona Simpson. He was raised on the Simpson farm by his parents until they were forced to move out due to Homer scaring the cows by jumping out of a bale of hay and scaring them into giving sour milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer began drinking alcohol, and accidentally caused a traffic jam in his Playschool car.</p>
                <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/7/79/Littlecrayons.jpg" alt="" align="right" height="120">
                <p>When Homer was seven, Mona went into hiding following a run-in with the law and faked her death, before that, she took Homer and Abe to the Woodstock Music Festival, where Homer ended up briefly adopting the Hippie lifestyle, to Abe's disapproval.</p>
                <p>At the age of 12, Homer, along with Lenny Leonard, Carl Carlson and Moe Szyslak went over to a deep gorge to swim, but the water was drained. When investigating why the lake was reduced to a muddy pit, he stumbled upon a decomposing corpse inside the pipe, greatly traumatizing him and possibly leading to his overeating habit.</p>
                <p>When he was 15, Homer participated in a beer drinking contest, lying that he was 22. However, he became so intoxicated that he ended up drinking a whole beer keg that was used to fill the contestants' cups. Eventually, Homer was so hungover, he had missed almost an entire month of school.</p>
                <p>Before beginning high school, Homer convinced his friend, Barney, to have one beer can. Barney, who was an aspiring student preparing for Harvard, was annoyed by Homer, and unwillingly drank one beer. However, Barney became a drunken wreck and presumably failed his SAT tests.</p>
                <p>Homer attended Springfield High School in September, 1972, and fell in love with Marge Bouvier. After graduating in June of 1974, Marge and Homer bought an apartment at Springfield Place together. During this time, Marge got a letter accepting her into a college. To pay for her tuition, Abe gives Homer a job at Simpson Laser Tag. The couple broke up for some time after Homer started a Grunge band called Sadgasm. Marge realizes that she really loves Homer, and she goes back to him. At some point between finishing high school and marrying Marge, Homer briefly served in the US Army. but never saw combat. Due to a clerical error, he was discharged two weeks early and years later after a disastrous dinner party with his old sergeant, Homer was forced to complete his tour of duty.</p>
                <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/4/41/Young_Marge_and_Homer_2.png" alt="" align="right" height="80">
                <p>In his early, 20s,  Homer was working at Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre, turning the crank that spining the windmill.</p>
                <p>The two got married on December 23, 1977, at Shotgun Pete's 24 Hour Wedding Chapel, a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spent their wedding reception alone at a truck stop, before ending up at the Bouvier House, where they lived at the time.</p>
                <p>After failing to get a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer left Marge to find a job by which he could support his family. He went to work at a taco restaurant called the Gulp 'n' Blow until Marge found him and convinced him to return home with her. As a result, Homer confronted Mr. Burns and secured a job at the Plant. Two years after Bart was born, Marge became pregnant with Lisa, shortly before they bought their first house. Homer's second leap to stardom was his success as the lead singer and songwriter for the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, even winning a Grammy. During his time with the group, Homer was frequently absent from home, which put stress on his marriage. After the group broke up due to creative differences, Homer went back to Springfield to continue his old life, their son Bart Simpson was born on  April 1, 1979, and their daughter Lisa Simpson on May 9, 1981.</p>
                <p>When in his 30s, Homer prepared a budget so that he could work at his dream job, a pin monkey at the Bowlarama Bowling Alley, owned by Barney's uncle Al Gumble. The budget included buying regular toilet paper and that only one of the kids could go to college. Unfortunately for Homer, Marge became pregnant with Maggie around this time, and he went back to the Nuclear Plant in order to support his family. Since then, Homer has started many jobs, but in the end, he always comes back to his job at the Nuclear Plant. He has nearly caused the destruction of Springfield a couple of times, after a nuclear meltdown at the plant and polluting Lake Springfield with his pet pig's (and his own) waste.</p>

            <!-- Personality -->
            <div>
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Homer is a pure moron who can go back and forth from being downright horrible to an extremely caring and loving man. Homer's personality is one of frequent immaturity, frequent stupidity, dim witness, selfishness, laziness, and explosive anger; one might say it is that of the "Average Joe". He also suffers from a short attention span which complements his intense but short-lived passion for hobbies, enterprises and various causes. Despite his family flaws, he is a loving father and husband, even if he can be ignorant or oblivious to families feelings and ideas. When he thinks he has let anyone he loves down, it really does affect him, and in the end, will do anything for them. Another contribute to his "Working Joe" persona was that he has also shown to be sensitive about his masculinity; being initially upset over Marge becoming a police officer as he thought it made her "the man of the house", as well as refusing to call a contractor when Marge wanted her kitchen remodeled as to not emasculate his pride.</p>
                <p>Homer is prone to emotional outbursts; he gets very envious of his neighbors, the Flanders family, and is easily enraged at his son, Bart, and strangles the boy in an exaggerated manner. His trademark phrase to strangling Bart, "Why you little...!" and on one occasion, "Why you little bastard!" He also spanks Bart sometimes and, in one case, Lisa. One time, he was too busy to spank them, so he told them to go to their rooms and spank themselves. He does not show compunction about this, and is not attempting to hide his actions from people outside the family, even showing disregard for his son's well being in other ways, such as leaving Bart alone at a port, or allowing Bart to go court for skateboarding naked on his dare when all he would have to do is attend a one hour parenting class signifying not only his disregard for Bart but his extreme laziness.</p>
                <!-- <p>Homer also possesses an extreme dislike for his sisters-in-law, Patty and Selma Bouvier. This is because they often talk down on him for the kind of man he is, selfish and dimwitted. He also openly calls them ugly. He uses labels such as "The Gruesome Twosome", "Fatty and Smellma" and "Two Sobbing Trolls". He also gave his children the impression that Patty and Selma are horrible and nasty witches, which is the reason why the kids don't like spending time with their aunts. The sisters in turn, hate Homer as much he hates them. Patty and Homer have a very vile, antagonistic relationship but his relationship with Selma has rarely softened up over the years.</p> -->
                <p>While Homer has repeatedly upset people and caused all sorts of mayhem in Springfield, these events are usually caused by either his explosive temper or lack of foresight. Except for expressing annoyance at Ned Flanders, Homer's actions are usually unintentional. Most of his explosive anger is targeted on Bart, because of something stupid or bad he had said or done. Despite their disadvantages, these common outbursts saved Homer from dying of a pentup rage-induced heart attack. Although he usually has an explosive temper, there are a few instances, usually in very serious situations, where Homer's anger was so subdued yet so immense that he outwardly appeared calm and spoke in an even-handed tone despite very clearly being outraged. Notable examples of this include when he learned that Bart had gone on a road trip via a fake license and are stuck in Tennessee doing odd jobs: He outwardly acted as if he was calm, and had to obscure his face to vent his anger enough to fog up his visor before adopting his calm exterior and vowed to send him money to get home before darkly stating that he'll murder him as soon as he gets home before Lisa talks him out of it. Another instance of this was when learning that Mr. Burns didn't address him in his thank you card, where after lowering the letter in an angry manner, he calmly requests that Bart and Lisa step outside for a second, with Bart and Lisa doing so without question and immediately due to being very scared at Homer's evidently furious appearance (although he then promptly manages to scream what is heavily implied to be the f-bomb after they've left in a loud enough volume that all of Springfield stopped what they were doing in shock). He also reacted like this to his father after the latter revealed that not only was Homer's own conception an accident, but implied that he would have been happier if he had never been born: After learning this, Homer gasped and braked to a stop immediately, before twice sternly telling Abraham Simpson to step out of the car in a calm yet clearly infuriated tone while scowling and not even looking at him, and then promptly driving away fast. He also initially acted like this when forced to adopt a swear jar and having to put coins in the swear jar to curb his swearing habits. When getting himself injured twice by accidentally breaking his thumb by whacking his thumb as well as impaling his foot with a nail deep enough as to require a tetnis shot, he initially robotically stated his first injury and then talking in a pseudo-kindly manner the second time while twitching with rage, before stating that, while he won't swear, he will kick the doghouse down, the last part he states by screaming it out in clear rage.</p>
                <p>While Homer's stupid antics often upset his family, he has also performed acts that reveal him to be a surprisingly loving father and husband, such as selling his cherished ride on the Duff Blimp and using the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself, giving up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear; spearheading an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well, even though he hates doing physical labor[40] and arranging a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their lousy first ceremony, even going so far as to hire one of The Doobie Brothers as part of the wedding band and getting a divorce from Marge, essentially making their second wedding a "real" one.</p>

                    <p>Homer is the husband of Marge Simpson. They met when they were younger without learning who each other was before meeting again properly in high school. They have had three weddings. The pair have a very strong marriage which has survived cheating, amnesia and many arguments. They have been in love since their high school senior year.</p><br>

                    <h3>Bart Simpson</h3>
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/d/db/Wmce.jpg" alt="" width="15%" align="left">
                    <p>Homer's relationship with Bart is a strange one indeed; Homer has threatened Bart with murder before, yet at other times, the two get along better than anyone else. Homer usually refers to Bart as "the boy" and has mentioned spanking and beating Bart before. All that is ever shown, however, is either Homer growling and lunging for Bart, chasing him, or else strangling him. Homer was held in a mental hospital once due to his aggression with Bart, although, once the doctors realized that Bart was, in fact, real, they released him. It is implied that Bart is the reason that Homer is bald. Homer blames most of his misfortunes on Bart and is the strict abuser of Bart in the strict abusive family. As a result, Bart usually takes advantage of his father's stupidity to humiliate him (as he does with most authority figures). Because of their often turbulent relationship, Bart commonly refers to Homer as Homer instead of Dad, especially when Bart is humiliating him. Homer has also implied that he wouldn't mind if Bart changed 100% and that he isn't very attached to him as he is.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Lisa Simpson</h3>
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/f/f6/Homer_holding_baby_Lisa.png" alt="" align="right" width="15%">
                    <p>Homer is very protective of Lisa and shows a soft side to her that Bart has never seen. She is his little girl and when Homer disappoints her or makes her sad he will often times go to the end of the earth to make things right. Homer sometimes does activities with Lisa which he doesn't enjoy simply to make her happy, such as attending the ballet. That being said, Lisa and Homer do not get along very well. When Homer does accompany Lisa on such intellectual trips he oftentimes embarrasses her, usually by either falling asleep, saying something rude or unintellectual, or else displaying disgusting habits (scratching his butt, burping, etc.). When Lisa becomes upset, Homer can't usually figure out what it is he did wrong. They have little to talk about because of their differences in interests and intellectual caliber, so Homer far prefers to do tasks with Bart and leave Lisa alone.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Maggie Simpson</h3>
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/d/d3/Homer_and_maggie.jpg" alt="" align="left" width="15%">
                    <p>Homer forgets Maggie exists—frequently. Once, when talking about their "two" children, Marge interrupted and told Homer that they had three children, to which he replied that the dog didn't count as a child before recalling Maggie. Similar dialogue is recurrent throughout the series. Also, whenever Maggie is referred to by her full name, Margaret, Homer has no clue as to who is being referenced. When Homer does try to interact with Maggie, he oftentimes frightens her unintentionally.</p>
