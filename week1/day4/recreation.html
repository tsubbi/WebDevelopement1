                    <h2>Hot Spring</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jiaoxi is famous for its ground-level hotspring, which is very rare, as most hotsprings must be drilled down to reach the hot water reservoirs. The water is naturally rich in minerals and is believed to be very good for the skin. Nonetheless many people are distrustful of the water quality, which is generally believed to be between Beitou (better) and Wulai (worse).

                    <h3>Public Hot Spring</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Jiaoxi Hot Spring Park</strong>
                        <br>
                        <img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-csLaYAbdFVc/Wb5sgqRb2eI/AAAAAAAAF8E/UF0To_wuocMAU2FqBk4IzYPjPWpkJFWPgCLcBGAs/s1600/Jiaoxi%2BHotsprings%2BPark%2BFree%2BFoot%2BSpa.JPG" alt="" class="img-align-right">
                        This charming, wooded park is only a few minutes walk from central Jiaoxi, conveniently located behind the intercity bus station. It's clearly been the focus of the millions of dollars being poured into Jiaoxi to turn it into a world class hot spring resort. Behind the free, public foot spa, towards the back of the park, are the best public hotsprings in Jiaoxi (admission NT150, or more for a towel or if you want to return later hat day). They include indoor and secluded outdoor baths, and are very tastefully decorated. Being Japanese style, swimsuits are not allowed (bathers are separated by gender) so it's essential to shower before entering.

                    <h3>Private Hot Spring Hotels</h3>
                    <p>The main hotspring street, which runs along Zhongxiao Road (德陽路) and Deyang Road (德陽路), a few minutes walk from the train station, has an "I want to be Japan" feel, with several hotels named after Japanese cities, most of which aren't even famous for hotsprings. The serious onsen enthusiasts from Japan might prefer to skip Jiaoxi's springs, but to the average passing tourist a hot spring will still be a very pleasant experience, especially after a day travelling and a hike up to see the Wufongci waterfalls.
    
                        There are large new hotspring hotels under construction around the Jiaoxi Hotsprings Park. These won't be much good until they are all complete, and will no doubt be expensive, but they look to be magnitudes of ten better than the hotspring hotels along Zhongxiao Road.

                    <h2>Waterfall</h2>
                    <p>A fantastic hike to visit a couple of high and dramatic waterfalls, Wufengchi and Yuemeikang, than finishes at the Linmei Shipan Trail.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-content">
                    <h2>Yuemeikeng Waterfall</h2>
                    <img src="https://p3n3w9t2.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/yuemeikeng-waterfall-jiaoxi-taiwan.jpg" alt="" class="img-align-right">
                    <p>Starting from nearly the same spot as Wufengqi, a more difficult and much lesser known hike leads to gorgeous Yuemeikeng Waterfall (月眉坑瀑布). Swimming is possible at the bottom of the 3-tiered curtain waterfall.</p>
                    <p>The hike to Yuemeikeng takes around two hours return, and involves a few river crossings (very shallow) and climbing down rocks with a rope. To find the trail from Wufengqi waterfall entrance, follow the trail downhill through the forest to Dezikou River Check Dam (得子口溪攔沙壩). Cross the dam over the river to find the trail entrance on the other side.</p>

                    <h3>Wufonci Waterfall</h3>
                    <p>
                        This charming trio of waterfalls is one of Taiwan's best. It takes about an hour to hike up to the third waterfall, allowing for stops at the previous two. Paths are well established, but can be crowded, especially on weekends. It's about one hour's walk (4km) to the falls from the train station, however you may regret the walk after hiking up to the falls; it's easier to take Bus 111 from the train station, or from the hotsprings along Zhongxiao Road (德陽路) and Deyang Road (德陽路).

            <!-- Fish Therapy -->

                <div class="sub-content">
                    <h2>Fish Therapy</h2>
                    <p>A foot spa, where millions of little teeth give you a foot massage/pedicure. The fish used for these fishy pedicures are called garra rufa and are toothless.</p>
                    <p>It’s a very simple procedure and anybody that can bend at the waist is able to take part. There are many different setups around the world, but the one at Jiaoxi slightly reminds me of a Japanese onsen. Shoes are removed and stored in a pigeonhole with your other belongings close to where you have the fishy pedi. Once shoes are removed it is time to wash your feet via one of the numerous hand showers along the wall. These are very much like what you would find in a Japanese onsen, but without the stools to sit on.</p>
                    <p>Once feet are washed you head to sit on the edge of one of two fish filled swimming pools. Place your feet in the water, there is a step running the length to rest on if you wish, and then wait for the fish to come to you.</p>
                    <p>Come they will, they will swarm to your feet and start gumming and sucking away. How long your feet stay as a source of nourishment for the fish depends on the amount of time you have purchased. I probably lasted about 10-15 minutes before the novelty wore off.</p>

                    <p>The top souvenir of Jiaoxi that is a very tasty cake roll for tourists to buy as their souvenir for remember this trip. With many different flavories such as taro, chocolate, strawberry and original famous milk roll that can be choosen by the customers. Since they don't have any additives, so it's can only last for 2 days.</p>

                    <h3>Green Onion Pancake</h3>
                    <p>The pancake, “蔥油餅”, was mixed with the locally grown spring onion. There was an eventual queue next to the shop. The shop is located directly outside a primary school.</p>
                    <p>The pancake with an egg for NT$35. It tasted almost like Indian cuisine, ‘prata’. Eating it while it pipping hot really warmed the body. It did not come with the pungent taste usually associated with spring onion. It had a tad sweetness in it.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended to apply generous topping of sweet-savoury sauce. If you want it spicy, you add their chilli sauce too.</p>
