                The special ground or crust stratum in Yilan County had made this area well known for its numerous hot springs, which are the result of air warmed by some source underground, and rising upward blended with under-layer water. Among them you would see the most historic "Jiaoxi Hot Spring," which is quite rare in Taiwan for its occurrence on a flatland. "Tangwei Hot Spring," meanwhile, has been famous since Qing Dynasty and placed on the list of "Eight Scenes of Lanyang Area."

            <p>The Jiaoxi Hot Spring originates at the foot of a hill behind Fuchung Temple at Deyang Village, Jiaoxi Township. While streaming along the ditches and highways, running through the railroads, the welling hot waters gather into a brook, serving local people as natural baths at the string of boiling ditches in ancient times.</p>

            <p>However, there are only two public bathhouses left for those who want to try an absolutely different bath. As an alkaline fountain, Jiaoxi Hot Spring is crystal-clear, odorless, yet contains a considerable amount of minerals like Potassium chloride, Sodium sulphide, Potassium hydrogen carbonate, Technical Granular, Floating Acids as well as rich organisms.</p>

            <p>Being honored as "The Hot Spring among Hot Springs," you would find your skin smooth and fine without the slightest stickiness after a bath at Jiaoxi.</p>

            <p>All these years the Farmer's Association of Jiaoxi has been developing hot spring vegetables, hot spring drinking water, and hot spring breeding. They devote themselves to give full play to the possible usage of hot spring, so as to gain financial ground for agricultural economy and tour industry in Jiaoxi.</p>

                Since the Hsuehshan Tunnel opened up the Northeast coast in 2006, road has been the most popular way to reach Jiaoxi and Yilan. Buses are run by the Kamalan Bus Company, and depart regularly from the fourth floor of the Taipei Bus Station (opposite Taipei Main Station). The journey takes approximately an hour and a half (in good traffic) and costs NT100.

                <br>
                Jiaoxi is also perfectly reachable by train, which should be the preferred option if coming from anywhere other than Taipei. Local trains from Taipei take two hours and cost NT128; it's also possible to take a faster train to Yilan, and then take a slower train back to Jiaoxi; this is the best option if coming from Hualien. Please note that most but not all express trains stop at Jiaoxi, so check with staff first. Some trains from Yilan (ten minutes south of Jiaoxi) don't stop until Songshan Station in Taipei, an hour and a half away.
